# Notification-System
Absolutely, let's delve deeper into the Scheduler component of your notification system. The Scheduler plays a pivotal role in managing and orchestrating the flow of notifications based on various events and timing requirements. We'll explore its responsibilities, design considerations, implementation strategies, interactions with other components, and best practices to ensure it operates efficiently and reliably.
ðŸ“… Scheduler: Detailed Design and Implementation
1. Role and Responsibilities of the Scheduler

The Scheduler is responsible for:

    Task Scheduling: Managing when notifications should be sent (immediately, after a delay, or at specific times).
    Event Handling: Responding to events triggered by the API or other components.
    Message Publishing: Sending structured messages to the message queue for further processing by other services like the Pipeline and Template Engine.
    Retry Mechanisms: Handling failed tasks by retrying them based on predefined policies.
    Concurrency Management: Ensuring tasks are processed concurrently without conflicts or resource contention.
    Monitoring and Logging: Tracking the status of s****cheduled tasks and logging relevant information for auditing and debugging.

2. Design Considerations

When designing the Scheduler, consider the following aspects:

    Scalability: Ability to handle a large number of scheduling tasks without performance degradation.
    Reliability: Ensuring that scheduled tasks are not lost and are executed even in the event of failures.
    Flexibility: Supporting various scheduling scenarios, such as immediate, delayed, recurring, or conditional notifications.
    Concurrency: Efficiently managing multiple tasks in parallel while avoiding race conditions.
    Persistence: Storing scheduled tasks in a durable medium to survive restarts or crashes.
    Monitoring and Alerting: Integrating with monitoring tools to track task statuses and system health.

Pipeline -> Template Engine -> Notification Delivery

    API Interaction: The API receives client requests (e.g., initiate payment) and delegates the scheduling of related notifications to the Scheduler.
    Task Scheduling: The Scheduler determines when the notification should be sent and publishes a corresponding message to the message queue.
    Message Queue Integration: Ensures decoupled communication between the Scheduler and other components.
    Processing Pipeline: Downstream services consume the messages, process them, and deliver notifications to users.

3.2. Folder Structure for Scheduler

Within the existing folder structure, the Scheduler can be organized as follows:

go

notification-system/
â”œâ”€â”€ internal/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scheduler/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scheduler.go
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tasks.go
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ storage.go
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ retry.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ ...

    scheduler.go: Core Scheduler logic.
    tasks.go: Definitions and management of scheduling tasks.
    storage.go: Persistence layer for storing scheduled tasks.
    retry.go: Logic for handling retries of failed tasks.

4. Implementation Strategies

There are multiple ways to implement a Scheduler in Go. Below are two common approaches:

    Using a Dedicated Scheduling Library: Leverage existing libraries like robfig/cron for cron-like scheduling or go-co-op/gocron for more flexible scheduling options.
    Custom Scheduler Implementation: Build a custom Scheduler tailored to your specific requirements, providing greater flexibility and control.

For this design, we'll focus on a Custom Scheduler Implementation to address various scheduling needs inherent to a payment gateway notification system.
4.1. Choosing the Right Persistence Layer

To ensure reliability, scheduled tasks should be persisted. This ensures that tasks are not lost in case of system restarts or failures. Common choices include:

    Database Storage: Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) or NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) to store scheduled tasks.
    Persistent Queues: Rely on the message queue's durability features to persist messages.

For enhanced reliability and flexibility, database storage is recommended, allowing the Scheduler to manage task metadata, execution status, and retry counts effectively.
4.2. Scheduler Components

    Task Definition: Define the structure of a scheduling task, including metadata like execution time, task type, payload, retry count, etc.
    Task Queueing: Implement mechanisms to enqueue tasks based on their scheduled execution time.
    Task Execution: Continuously monitor and execute tasks when their scheduled time arrives.
    Retry Logic: Handle task failures by retrying them based on predefined policies (e.g., exponential backoff).
    Concurrency Control: Manage concurrent execution of multiple tasks efficiently.
    Graceful Shutdown: Ensure that ongoing tasks are completed or safely terminated during system shutdowns.

4.3. Sample Implementation

Below is a sample implementation of the Scheduler in Go, incorporating the aforementioned components.
a. Models Definition

Define the data structures for tasks.

go

// internal/models/models.go

package models

import (
    "time"
)

// Task represents a scheduling task
type Task struct {
    ID           string                 `json:"id" bson:"_id"`
    Type         string                 `json:"type" bson:"type"` // e.g., "SendOTP"
    Payload      map[string]interface{} `json:"payload" bson:"payload"`
    ScheduledAt  time.Time              `json:"scheduled_at" bson:"scheduled_at"`
    CreatedAt    time.Time              `json:"created_at" bson:"created_at"`
    Retries      int                    `json:"retries" bson:"retries"`
    MaxRetries   int                    `json:"max_retries" bson:"max_retries"`
    LastError    string                 `json:"last_error" bson:"last_error"`
    Status       string                 `json:"status" bson:"status"` // e.g., "pending", "completed", "failed"
}

b. Scheduler Logic

Implement the core Scheduler functionalities.

go

// internal/scheduler/scheduler.go

package scheduler

import (
    "context"
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "notification-system/internal/messaging
